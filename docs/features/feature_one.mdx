## Draw.io Diagram
You can embed draw.io diagrams directly like this.  Naming the files with .drawio.svg allows you to embed an editable diagram and easily edit with the vscode draw.io plugin.

Draw.io includes by default an SVG 1.1 compatibility warning.  Due to the nature of the tools used to build a docusaurus site will always show up if you embed a drawing this way.  

**To disable** this warning, in the draw.io editor, choose File -> Properties and disable the SVG 1.1 warning checkbox.

```jsx
import SampleDrawing from './feature_one.drawio.svg';

<SampleDrawing className="drawio" />

```

import SampleDrawing from './feature_one.drawio.svg';

<SampleDrawing className="drawio" />


## Mermaid Diagrams

```markdown
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant Application

        User->>+Application: User uses Application
        Application->>-User: Application returns the result
    ```
```
